## Career Tracker
This project consists of a GUI that allows user to have a good tracking of its career track by using sliders with 0-100% percentage of completion for each task, and representing the level of completion of those tasks in a Gantt board below. The data of the goals achieved can easily be updated through the GUI easily.
